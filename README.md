# üß† Python Quiz App

A simple quiz app in Python that I built based on a YouTube tutorial.  
I expanded the basic version with a few extra features, including:

- Choose how many questions you want to answer
- Option to play the quiz again after finishing

## üöÄ How does it work?

The quiz asks you multiple choice questions. At the beginning, you choose how many questions you want.  
After finishing, you'll see your score and have the option to play again.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Try it out

Make sure you have Python (3.x) installed.  
Then run the script via the terminal or an IDE like VS Code or PyCharm:

```bash
python PythonQuiz.py

# The classic Hangman game
The good old hangman game which I built based on a youtube video to practice my Python skills.

## üöÄ How does it works
There is a secret word, which you have to guess. You guess a letter and the program tells you whether the letter appears in the word or not. You get a set amount of guesses.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Try it out

Make sure you have Python (3.x) installed.
